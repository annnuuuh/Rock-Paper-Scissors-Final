# Mod 1 Final Solo Project
## Rock, Paper, Scissors!

#### Overview
This is a Rock, Paper, Scissors game that allows users to battle a computer player in two versions of the game, Classic & Spicy!

In this project, I was instructed to use the Data Model to build out the functionality of both game options. As you'll see, all DOM manipulation is located in the main.js file while all game functionality is housed within game.js and activity.js files. Additionally, localStorage is used to save each players wins. In the event that you need to reload the page, all player wins data will be saved and persist on page load. Fancy! ðŸŽ€

#### Languages & Libraries
HTML
CSS
JAVASCRIPT

#### File Architecture
*assets* -- This is where all assets used in this web app or in this README live.

*player.js* -- This is the framework for both players, the human user and the computer.

*game.js* -- This is the game board! All functionality of the game lives here.

*main.js* -- DOM functionality! This is where the magic, that the user sees, lives.

*index.html* -- This is where all of the html lives! ðŸ’€

*styles.css* -- This is where all of the styling lives. ðŸ‘—



#### Local Installation
I know you just can't wait to play! Go ahead and follow the handy steps below for installing this app.

Open your Terminal and navigate to the directory you would like to store this web app inside of.

Once you are in the directory, execute the following commands:

`git clone git@github.com:annnuuuh/Rock-Paper-Scissors-Final.git`

`cd Rock-Paper-Scissors-Final`

`open index.html`

Ready, get set.... BATTLE!


#### Future Iterations
In a future state, I'd like to take more time to re-work my approach to displaying the selected fighters side-by-side after each round. I know there must be a simpler approach! Additionally, I'd like to create the ability for each player to choose a token from a selection of token options. This not only would make the game more fun but would also be inclusive for any user that chooses to play.
