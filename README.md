In this project, I was instructed to use the Data Model to build out the functionality of both game options. As you'll see, all DOM manipulation is located in the main.js file while all game functionality is housed within game.js and activity.js files. Fancy! ðŸŽ€

#### Languages & Libraries
HTML
CSS
JAVASCRIPT

#### File Architecture
*assets* -- This is where all assets used in this web app or in this README live.
*player.js* -- This is the framework for both players, the human user and the computer.
*game.js* -- This is the game board! All functionality of the game lives here.
*main.js* -- DOM functionality! This is where the magic, that the user sees, lives.
*index.html* -- This is where all of the html lives! ðŸ’€
